          The Lambda Wiki is intended to compliment the <a href="https://tk.lambdaschool.com/">Lambda Training Kit</a> by providing a collaborative separation from the syllabus and individual assignments.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Any <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda</a> students may submit new entries in new/existing categories pending admin (Project Manager/Instructor) approval <Link to="/">here</Link>.
          These entries aren't limited to things studied in class but anything pertaining to programming/comp sci, feel free to add anything interesting you've learned about on your own.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Wiki entries are formatted in <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Github-Flavored Markdown</a> for the time being.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Graduating students will also have perpetual access to the materials in this wiki, so youâ€™ll continue to benefit from the improvements made over time.
